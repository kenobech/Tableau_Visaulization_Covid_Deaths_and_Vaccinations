# Tableau_Visaulization_Covid_Deaths_and_Vaccinations
# Introduction
This project aims to visualize COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations data using Tableau. The visualization provides insights into the global impact of COVID-19, including death rates, vaccination progress, and population infection rates.
# Dataset

Total COVID Deaths by Location

    Calculates the total number of COVID deaths by location, excluding continents and specific entities like "World", "European Union", and "International".

Population Infection Rate by Location

    Calculates the highest infection count and percent population infected for each location.

Population Infection Rate Over Time

    Calculates the highest infection count and percent population infected for each location over time.

Rolling People Vaccinated by Location

    Calculates the rolling number of people vaccinated by location over time.

Percent Population Vaccinated

    Calculates the percentage of the population vaccinated for each location.
